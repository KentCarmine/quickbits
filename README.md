# What is QuickBits
Millions of people are transferring files everyday.  Services such as Dropbox, BitTorrent and basic email have been created to deal with this need.  However all of these services have many drawbacks, which keep the user from realizing the true potential of file transfer on the modern web.  Quick Bits is a browser based application that allows a user to easily transfer files from their browser to a friends browser, in an anonymous, secure way.
