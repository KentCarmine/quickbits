<p><strong>How do I use Quickbits?</strong></p>
<li>1. Just drag and drop or select a file you want to send to a friend</li>
<li>2. A link will appear.  Send this link to whom ever you want to transfer the file to.</li>
<li>3. Once your friend enters the link into the browser the file will automatically begin transferring</li>
<br>

<p><strong>Why is this better then email?</strong></p>
<li>Email is usually limited to files less then 25MB</li>
<li>Your email provider will store your private information</li>
<li>The file transfer is significantly slower</li>
<li>The email address of the receiver is required</li>
<br>

<p><strong>Why is this different from Dropbox and Yousendit?</strong></p>
<li>Quickbits does not store any file, infact Quickbits has no database at all</li>
<li>Services like Dropbox require you to upload a file directly to their server, and only once the file has finished uploading can your friend begin downloading</li>
<li>Quickbits connects you directly to your friend allowing for much quicker file transfer</li>

<p><strong>Why do you only support Firefox?</strong></p>
<li>Since the technology that powers Quickbits <a href=http://www.webrtc.org/> WebRTC</a> is relatively new all the bugs are still being worked out with other browsers</li>

<p><strong>Do you store any data?</strong></p>
<li>Quickbits is strongly against storing any user data, our site does not even have a database</li>


<p><strong>Who are you?</strong></p>
<li>We are five students at <a href=http://www.devbootcamp.com>Dev Bootcamp</a>, and Quickbits is our final project in the class</li>

<p><strong>Why are you so excited about this technology?</strong></p>
<li>We feel that WebRTC will significantly change the way we interact with one another through video, audio and file sharing</li>
<li>Google has a few interesting talks on the subject <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8C8ouiXHHk> Here</a></li>

<p><strong>Where can I report a bug?</strong></p>
<li>We are committed to continual improvement of this tool thank you for taking the time to give us feedback.</li>
<li>Any comments, bug reports or great jokes can be sent to team@quickbits.co</li>
